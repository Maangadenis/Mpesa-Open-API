This is Mpesa open API to intergrate C2B.

The C2B API call is used as a standard customer-to-business transaction. Funds from the customerâ€™s mobile money wallet will be deducted and be transferred to the mobile money wallet of the business. To authenticate and authorize this transaction, M-Pesa Payments Gateway will initiate a USSD Push message to the customer to gather and verify the mobile money PIN number. This number is not stored and is used only to authorize the transaction.
